//! Live key capture for one keyboard: divert the bound `0x1b04` controls and
//! turn their physical edges into [`CapturedInput`] the agent can dispatch.
//!
//! [`run_keyboard_capture_session`] is the keyboard counterpart of
//! [`crate::session::gesture::run_capture_session`], and runs the same channel
//! lifecycle: one open channel, one message listener, and every diverted
//! control handed back to the firmware on shutdown. What is its own is the
//! arming — diversion on exactly the controls the caller asks for (an unbound
//! key is never diverted, so it keeps its native firmware function) — and the
//! edge decoding.
//!
//! Which controls exist is the keyboard's business: the caller names them by
//! control ID ([`ButtonId::Control`]) and this session diverts whichever of
//! them the device's own `0x1b04` table reports as divertable, so a key
//! OpenLogi has no catalog row for is captured exactly like a known one.
//!
//! Diversion works on the key's *control* — the printed media/shortcut
//! function — so it fires when Fn-lock is off (or via Fn+key when it is on).
//! The plain F1–F12 codes of an Fn-locked row travel the ordinary HID keyboard
//! interface and never reach `0x1b04`.
